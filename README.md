# Quick Log

**My Reason for Improvement**
I lose a lot of time trying to log in to my accounts on new computers, for example once I went to an internet cafe to play a game with my friends and I lost half an hour to an hour just because I couldn't remember my password.

I developed it for myself but you can download and use it too

You can quickly log in to your Google accounts, in this project you can quickly log in to these accounts:
  - Gmail
  - Instagram
  - Discord
  - Github

**The following libraries must be installed:**
```bash
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver_manager
pip install Flask
pip install flask-socketio

pip install icecream
pip install pyautogui
pip install pywebview

**Important**
- Google Chrome must be installed

- sometimes xpaths change in discord, so you may need to make adjustments if it is not working
