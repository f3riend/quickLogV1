# Quick Log

**My Reason for Improvement**
I lose a lot of time trying to log in to my accounts on new computers, for example once I went to an internet cafe to play a game with my friends and I lost half an hour to an hour just because I couldn't remember my password.

I developed it for myself but you can download and use it too
